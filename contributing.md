Hello, I am Jaskirat Singh. I am a MEAN stack developer. I tried to run your project.
I found some changes to be there in the readme directory:
Change 1:
You should have step for npm install (for sure!!). I knew it so wasn't a problem for me but is necessary.
Change 2:
Please change the routing workflow. Sorry to say but it's quite annoying.
Change 3:
Specify which route goes where in the code.(like "/" => HomePage)
Thank you.
I am a GSSOC aspirant and hope to contribute more in the project.
Please share your contact details with me for further discussions.
